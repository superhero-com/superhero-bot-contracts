## Smart Contracts
This repository contains Smart Contracts for Superhero bot.

### Account Verification

The `AccountVerification.aes` smart contract, enables users to verify their Matrix account on the aeternity blockchain for use with our chatbots. This verification is accomplished through a signature from the bot account, which manages interactions in the Matrix chat room. To successfully verify, a valid signature from the bot is required for the given Matrix user ID, formatted as THE_BOT_VERIFIES_[USER_ID]. Each user can validate only one Aeternity address. It's important to note that successive verifications will overwrite earlier ones.
